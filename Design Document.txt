Short Pitch
* Turn-based dungeon crawler game but using chess-like rules

Story/setup
* World has ended - you help some kind of eccentric time-mage/engineer trying to figure out what happened - and potentially save the world (probably some kind of twist where your reality is lost no matter what, so youï¿½re just helping research for another dimension. 

Game-loop
* Set up a team of 3 heroes
* Enter a "Dungeon" (one or multiple linked fights)
* Complete combat
* Get loot and/or progress
* Improve team/heroes/etc.
* Repeat

Combat
* One move/action in total pr. turn - like chess (test if one move + one action feels better).
* Combat AI based on Monte Carlo Tree search 

Meta-progression
* Gear/Items
* New Heroes
* Spells and Spell books
* Buildings/areas restored from time - unlocks some heroes, quests, buffs, game systems
